#Learn how to Work with **Numbers** and **Strings** by Implementing the Luhn Algorithm

The Luhn Algorithm is widely used for error-checking in various applications, such as verifying credit card numbers.

By building this proyect, you'll gain experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation

Funtions that I learned:

    - variable_name[start:stop:step]
    - str.maketrans({'x': 'y'. 'a': 'b'})




my_list = [1, 2]

my_list.append(3)
print(my_list)

print(my_list[0])

my_list[0] = 0
print(my_list)

my_list.insert(1, 1)
print(my_list)

my_list.pop()
print(my_list)
